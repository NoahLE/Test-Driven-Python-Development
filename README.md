# Test-Driven Python Development

This is the source code from Harry Percival's book [Test-Driven Python Development](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/).

## Getting set up

Make sure `Python 3.6.X` is installed.

From the root directory, install the requirements file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Notes

These are caveats I found when getting going through the book. They're mostly notes to myself for future reference.

### Chapter 1

#### Section 0

Make sure to read [the prerequisites](https://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/book/pre-requisite-installations.html) when getting your environement set up.
